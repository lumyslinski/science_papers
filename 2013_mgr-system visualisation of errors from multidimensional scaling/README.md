This paper describes a master's thesis about a visualisation system of errors produced by MDS algorithm which scales multidimensional data. The idea is to draw various types of lines between objects to represent the values of those errors:
* dashed line and blue heatmap for negative value
* straight line and green heatmap for zero value
* curved (sinusoidal line) and red heatmap for positive value
